                    <p>PSU-AC celebrates Women's Month 2024
                        —To honor women and their contributions to the world—Pangasinan State University-Asingan Campus
                        participated in the nationwide Women's Month Celebration on March 15, 2024. The event was organized
                        by Ms. Wennalyn D. Honrado, GAD coordinator, together with the working committees led by Dr. Madlyn
                        D. Tingco, Campus Executive Director, aimed to promote gender equality and inclusivity in the
                        society. The theme of the celebration was "LIPUNANG PATAS SA BAGONG PILIPINAS: KAKAYAHAN NG
                        KABABAIHAN, PATUTUNAYAN!"
                        Furthermore, two of the important leaders of Asingan supported the event, the Municipal Mayor,
                        Hon. Carlos F. Lopez, and Municipal Vice Mayor Hon. Heidee L. Ganigan Chua. Their presence
                        emphasized the importance of women that play a vital role in the community.
                        The dynamic Guest of Honor and Speaker, Atty. Agnes Joyce G. Bailen discussed the history of
                        women's rights in this country. She also acknowledged numerous women in the province who fought
                        for women's rights and defeated oppression. Atty. Bailen also accentuates the interdependence
                        between human and women's rights.
                        Moreover, the program highlighted the necessity of empowering young people to become champions for
                        gender equality and inclusivity in the communities which they belong. By celebrating young
                        people's initiatives in promoting these virtues, the young people will create a society that
                        cherish diversity and inclusion.
                        The 2024 Campus Women's Month Celebration at PSU Asingan Campus was a valuable and inspiring to
                        actively promote gender equality and diversity among the different communities of the stakeholders.
                        It emphasized the necessity of working together to build a society that embrace diversity and
                        allows everyone to live with respect and and acceptance.</p>
